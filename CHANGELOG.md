## 3.0.0 / 2019-03-04

This release contains **BREAKING CHANGES!**

- Improve configuration:<br>
   [(See details)](http://wsgidav.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide_configure.html)
  - **Rename some options**, e.g. `acceptDigest` => `http_authenticator.accept_digest`
  - WsgiDAVApp constructor now assumes default settings. The passed options
    override those.
  - Log format is configurable
  - Remove option `dir_browser.enabled` (modify `middleware_stack` instead)
  - CLI supports `--server=gevent` (gevent must be installed separately)
  - SSL paths are evaluated relative to the config file, if any
  - Refactor middleware stack
    - RequestResolver and WsgiDavDirBrowser are now simple members of `middleware_stack`
      and not specially treated
    - `middleware_stack` entries can also be strings or dicts that are
    evaluated to import and instantiate middleware classes. This allows to
    define and configure external middleware in YAML and JSON config files.
  - provider_mapping option now supports configuration of custom providers
  - Windows XP (Microsoft-WebDAV-MiniRedir/5.1.2600) had a bug
    when accessing a share '/dav/': XP sometimes sends digests for '/'.
    In v.2.4 a hotfix was also accept '/' instead of the real share.
    This is now disabled by default, but can be re-enabled with
    hotfixes.winxp_accept_root_share_login: true.
- Refactor code base:
  - **Rename methods** according to PEP 8, e.g.
    `provider.getResourceInst()` => `provider.get_resource_inst()`.
  - **Rename methods arguments** according to PEP 8, e.g.
    `provider.set_last_modified(self, destPath, timeStamp, dryRun)`
    => `provider.set_last_modified(self, dest_path, time_stamp, dry_run)`
  - Enforce [Black code style](https://github.com/ambv/black)
  - Move some modules to separate packages
  - Use utf-8 directive in source files (-*- coding: utf-8 -*-)
- Refactor domain_controller and authentication:
  - Renamed environ["http_authenticator.realm"], environ["http_authenticator.user_name"]
    => environ["wsgidav.auth.realm"], environ["wsgidav.auth.user_name"]
  - DC may define environ["wsgidav.auth.roles"] and environ["wsgidav.auth.permissions"]
  - A common base class simplifies implementation of custom DCs.
  - New [PAMDomainController](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluggable_authentication_module)
    allows to authenticate system users on Linux and macOS, for example.
  - Digest hash generation is now delegated to DomainControllers. This allows
    to implement DomainControllers that support digest access authentication
    even if plain-text passwords are not accessible, but stored hashes are.
  - Every domain controller now has a config section of its own. E.g.
    the `user_mapping` option for `SimpleDomainController` was moved to
    `simple_dc.user_mapping`.
- `SimpleDomainController` no longer allows anonymous access by default.
  It is now required to pass `simple_dc.user_mapping: "share1": True`.
  Also a new pseudo-share `"*"` can be used to define defaults.
  A new command line option `--auth` allows quick-configuration of DCs
- Refactor WsgiDirBrowser:
  - Use Jinja2 and load static assets through own WsgiDAV provider
  - Move to `wsgidav.dir_browser` package
  - Option 'dir_browser.ms_sharepoint_support' replaces ms_sharepoint_plugin and ms_sharepoint_urls
- Automated [Docker builds](https://hub.docker.com/r/mar10/wsgidav/)
- MSI installer
  - uses Cheroot/6.4 Python 3.6
  - Includes NTDomainController
- #112: Added limited support for Microsoft's Win32LastModified property.
- Fix #123: HEAD request on DirBrowser folder
