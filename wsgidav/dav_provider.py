Abstract base class for DAV resource providers.

This module serves these purposes:

  1. Documentation of the DAVProvider interface
  2. Common base class for all DAV providers
  3. Default implementation for most functionality that a resource provider must
     deliver.

If no default implementation can be provided, then all write actions generate
FORBIDDEN errors. Read requests generate NOT_IMPLEMENTED errors.


**_DAVResource, DAVCollection, DAVNonCollection**

Represents an existing (i.e. mapped) WebDAV resource or collection.

A _DAVResource object is created by a call to the DAVProvider.

The resource may then be used to query different attributes like ``res.name``,
``res.isCollection``, ``res.getContentLength()``, and ``res.supportEtag()``.

It also implements operations, that require an *existing* resource, like:
``getPreferredPath()``, ``createCollection()``, or ``getPropertyValue()``.

Usage::

    res = provider.getResourceInst(path, environ)
    if res is not None:
        print(res.getName())



**DAVProvider**

A DAV provider represents a shared WebDAV system.

There is only one provider instance per share, which is created during
server start-up. After that, the dispatcher (``request_resolver.RequestResolver``)
parses the request URL and adds it to the WSGI environment, so it
can be accessed like this::

    provider = environ["wsgidav.provider"]

The main purpose of the provider is to create _DAVResource objects for URLs::

    res = provider.getResourceInst(path, environ)


**Supporting Objects**
The DAVProvider takes two supporting objects:

propertyManager
   An object that provides storage for dead properties assigned for webDAV resources.

   PropertyManagers must provide the methods as described in
   ``wsgidav.interfaces.propertymanagerinterface``

   See property_manager.PropertyManager for a sample implementation
   using shelve.

lockManager
   An object that provides storage for locks made on webDAV resources.

   LockManagers must provide the methods as described in
   ``wsgidav.interfaces.lockmanagerinterface``

   See lock_manager.LockManager for a sample implementation
   using shelve.

See `Developers info`_ for more information about the WsgiDAV architecture.

    A resource may be a collection (aka 'folder') or a non-collection (aka

    In the example above, res will be ``None``, if the path cannot be mapped to

        res.provider
        res.name

        This function

          - moves this resource and all members to destPath.
          - MUST NOT move associated locks.
            Instead, if the source (or children thereof) have locks, then
            these locks should be removed.
          - SHOULD maintain associated live properties, when applicable
            See http://www.webdav.org/specs/rfc4918.html#dav.properties
          - MUST maintain associated dead properties
          - raises HTTP_FORBIDDEN for read-only resources
          - raises HTTP_INTERNAL_ERROR on error

        An implementation may choose to apply other semantics.
        For example copying '/by_tag/cool/myres' to '/by_tag/new/myres' may
        simply add a 'new' tag to 'my_res'.

        This method is only called, when self.supportRecursiveMove() returns
        True. Otherwise, the request server implements MOVE using delete/copy.

        This method MAY be implemented in order to improve performance.
