Abstract base class of a domain controller (used by HTTPAuthenticator).

This ABC serves as base class for DomainControllers and provides some
default implementations.

Domain controllers are called by `HTTPAuthenticator` to handle these tasks:

- Basic authentication:
  Check if user_name/password is allowed to perform a request

- Digest authentication (optional):
  Check if user_name is allowed to perform a request and return the MD5 hash.

- Define permissions and roles for a given user (optional).


Note that there is no checking for `isinstance(BaseDomainController)` in the
code, so WsgiDAV also accepts duck-typed domain controllers.

Digest Authentication
---------------------

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication


Permissions and Roles
---------------------

A domain controller MAY add entries to the `environment["wsgidav.auth. ..."]`
namespace in order to define access permissions for the following middleware
(e.g. dav_explorer) and DAV providers.

TODO: Work In Progress / Subject to change
