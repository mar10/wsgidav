    This scenario runs some tests against a WebDAV server.
    We use it to test stressor against a locally running WsgiDAV server:
    - Open a terminal and run
      $ wsgidav --root tests/stressor/htdocs --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8082 --auth anonymous --no-config
    - Open a second terminal and run
      $ stressor run tests/stressor/test_rw -q
  verbose: 3
  base_url: http://127.0.0.1:8082
  # base_url: https://127.0.0.1:8082
  request_timeout: 1

# Initial context value definitions.
# All used parameters must be listed here in the form:
#   parameter_name: default_value
# Set `null` value to make it mandatory, i.e. must be passed by caller.
